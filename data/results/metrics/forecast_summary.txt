## Forecast Summary
- MAE (model): 59,561
- MAE (seasonal-naive, 7D): 112,577  → Improvement vs naive: 47.1%
- SMAPE: 6.7%
- Payday diagnostic: residuals 27.2% lower → spikes largely captured.

## Recommendations
- Keep SARIMAX as baseline; add exogenous flags (payday, holidays, promos).
- Track weekly MAE vs seasonal-naive to detect drift.
